# Intro with AI
With ChatGPT was a popular topic within the tech field since its launch within the AI/ML category, AI tools have been evolving so quickly due to the nature of Generative AIs or "LLMs" that can generate any content.

ChatGPT has been proven it can do tasks that would help us from planning, drafting, or even fun conversations that a regular person that engage into any topic. It had a lot of its potential, while comes at limitations such as inaccuracies.

With the launch of GPT-4 as a paid plan for ChatGPT subscribers since March, it had its promising aspects. For instance, the ability to reason better compared to the GPT-3.5 model, can do more complex tasks like coding and several mathematical equations, and to rectify its answers even better. 

The paid plan of ChatGPT also evolves from providing priority access to GPT-4 to be extended with Plugins, Web Browsing with Bing, Code interpreter, Document attachment and even had the ability to create images with Dall-E 3 directly.

Since then, free version of ChatGPT didn't receive some limited features that came from the pro plan. It only includes 3.5 model updates, the ability to use custom instructions, chat sharing, and voice. This is only good for **most basic** tasks.

# Exploring alternatives
With the ChatGPT became the hottest tools on the AI field during its post-launch, competition have begun. For instance, Bing (Copilot) gained its chat feature **Powered by GPT-4**, this is the easiest and the only way to use GPT-4 for free (now it offers a paid plan for accessing gpt4-turbo) and offers goodies such as having internet access by default, limited plugins support, image and voice, and dall-e 3 image generation for free (with limited cap). Bing was preferred way to use the latest openai models albeit with censorship and performance caps in place.

Along with Bard which uses in house Google models (from Lamda -> Palm -> Gemini). It functions the same as ChatGPT or Bing Chat, albeit has internet access by default and image input, Bing chat however still outperforms Bard.

Many of these tools are free to use, with limitations, some paid offerings are mentioned as part of a limitation. Here are the Good ChatGPT alternatives and other AI tools:
# Chat
## Bing Chat (Microsoft Copilot)
*Link:* https://bing.com/chat \| https://copilot.microsoft.com 

This is currently the only way to get access to GPT-4 model for free during non-peak times, with **Internet access with Bing**, plugins support, ability to create images with **DALL-E 3**, and soon Code Interpreter: the ability to execute code while generating output based from the results.

The recommended way to get the most of this utility is to **Use Microsoft Edge** with **Microsoft Account** signed in. You can use this tool to other browsers but it will be limited (no history, no plugins, limited number of responses)

Here are the prompts to get inspired: 

- What is the latest news in tech
- Create an image of Spongebob shaking hands with sonic (*Microsoft account required*)
- Generate me a song about ... (*Microsoft copilot site with suno plugin enabled is required*)

**Limitations:** 

- Image generation is capped 15 generations per day (100 per day if you upgraded to copilot pro)
- Suno plugin can only take 5 songs per day
- Censorship and performance caps

**Recommendations:**
Use [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) instead of the Bing chat's interface as it supports Chrome and other web browsers, with plugins and history support. This website also has [Suno Plugin](https://blogs.bing.com/search/december-2023/Turn-your-ideas-into-songs-with-Suno-on-Microsoft) available (MS account required), this is what Microsoft is working on and it is recommended to go here instead.

## Google Bard

Lets you access to Google's in house LLM models (currently [Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/)). Has internet access, history, extensions, and image recognition and generation abilities.

**Tips:**  
Enable extensions to work with your email, files, navigation or youtube  
- What's hot in my inbox

# Developer tools for making AI
THESE are for coders, programmers or developers who wish to integrate AI into their apps from scripts to websites!

OpenAI apis are expensive due to the cost, OpenAI documents a pricing for each models for your apps to use, but you pay as use go, meaning as you use and generate content (to ask quesitons) with it, you are already spending your credits. Therefore here are free tools to use AI within your apps or explore how AI is trained or generate variations.

## Makersuite (Google AI studio)
*Link:* https://makersuite.google.com and https://ai.google.dev (Not the vertex one)

Allows developers to use and explore Gemini APIs for generating content for their apps that suites their needs or just want to make their own chatbot personalized with their own instructions, safety settings, and variations.

Gemini is what powers up [Bard](#google-bard).
