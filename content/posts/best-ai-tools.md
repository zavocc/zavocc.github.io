# Intro with AI
With ChatGPT was a popular topic within the tech field since its launch within the AI/ML category, AI tools have been evolving so quickly due to the nature of Generative AIs or "LLMs" that can generate any content.

ChatGPT has been proven it can do tasks that would help us from planning, drafting, or even fun conversations that a regular person that engage into any topic. It had a lot of its potential, while comes at limitations such as inaccuracies.

With the launch of GPT-4 as a paid plan for ChatGPT subscribers since March, it had its promising aspects. For instance, the ability to reason better compared to the GPT-3.5 model, can do more complex tasks like coding and several mathematical equations, and to rectify its answers even better. 

The paid plan of ChatGPT also evolves from providing priority access to GPT-4 to be extended with Plugins, Web Browsing with Bing, Code interpreter, Document attachment and even had the ability to create images with Dall-E 3 directly.

Since then, free version of ChatGPT didn't receive some limited features that came from the pro plan. It only includes 3.5 model updates, the ability to use custom instructions, chat sharing, and voice. This is only good for **most basic** tasks.

# Exploring alternatives
With the ChatGPT became the hottest tools on the AI field during its post-launch, competition have begun. For instance, Bing (Copilot) gained its chat feature **Powered by GPT-4**, this is the easiest and the only way to use GPT-4 for free (now it offers a paid plan for accessing gpt4-turbo) and offers goodies such as having internet access by default, limited plugins support, image and voice, and dall-e 3 image generation for free (with limited cap). Bing was preferred way to use the latest openai models albeit with censorship and performance caps in place.

Along with Bard which uses in house Google models (from Lamda -> Palm -> Gemini). It functions the same as ChatGPT or Bing Chat, albeit has internet access by default and image input, Bing chat however still outperforms Bard.

Here are the Good ChatGPT alternatives and other AI tools:
