Hello! I'm **marcusz**! (also known as ***WMCB Tech***, internally known as ***@zavocc***) and I'm a tech person who has strong interest with computers, mobile devices, and other technology since childhood. I experiment, tinker, spend time with it mostly.

# Background
As I spend time with using computers and mobile devices, I do use it for the inner workings of the technology as new tools are evolving, especially with the rise of conversational AIs like ChatGPT or Bing Chat. 

I make content on social media (Primarily YouTube but right now it's occasional at the moment), learning programming languages and tools, troubleshooting, virtualization, gaming, and yet I like to procrastinate.

I used to have projects and previous social media before and iterated my profile in 2020, now I started fresh again since 2022 with username "zavocc" as internet reserves identity for *marcusz* which is my real name without the *z*. I have my old git projects and other social media data from 2020-2021, right now it's in my archives. Uploaded a lot of videos on YouTube before about Android, but a lot of them is unlisted and was in archives playlist as it is very outdated to even work today.

I'm also part of [Termux](https://termux.dev) organization before as I contribute to porting Xfce whiskermenu, merging htop and htop-static into a single package to work with non-rooted devices, enabled other QEMU targets to run Mac OS 9 on my device. However, at the moment I was retired as I have to adjust my life, don't ask me about this as I only spit facts.
